# Wetty_Portfolio
This repo holds projects I have found interesting enough to share while learning to code.

The projects are broken up into a couple of categories based off where I built them.

# 1. Personal Projects
  These are mostly assignments from class or problems posed by friends and mentors
  that I'm curious to explore further. I will do my best to document them to make
  it easier to follow along.
  
# 2. Codewars Highlights
  These are shorter code snippets, normally one function, that were built on the
  website Codewars.com. This was recommended by a good friend and I have really
  enjoyed getting a little bit of exercise for my problem solving skills.
  
# 3. UMN-CSCI
  As I am a student at the University of Minnesota, I am taking some courses in
  Computer Science. Contained in this directory are exercises from lecture and
  coding labs as well as some homework assignments that I found interesting
  or educational.
  
As I am relatively new to coding, the code in this repo may not be "Professional
Quality" but I am constantly working to improve and am encouraged by my growth in
the recent months. In order to continue on this path, I appreciate and encourage 
any and all criticisms and comments.

Thanks for checking out my work!
